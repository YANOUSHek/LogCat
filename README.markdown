LogCat
======

LogCat is an adb logcat viewer written in Objective-C and designed with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines in mind. It uses the native GUI views and is a lot nicer for the eyes than the Eclipse plugins.

Originally written by Janusz Bossy who is a mobile device programmer. 
He's been working with Windows Mobile and iOS for quite some time. When Janusz started Android development he found Eclipse as the main frustration generator. It offers a lot of tools to get the job done but the quality of their design is poor. Janusz started using [eclim][eclim] on a regular
basis which allowed him to write code in Vim but he was lacking a small app that would display Android logs and allow for easy filtering and searching within them. Here it is - LogCat - a simple log viewer for Android.
